This project will be focused on the neighborhoods of Toronto and New York City. There are different categories of venues show in each neighborhood in each city. They will be classified by implementing classification method to see some some insights of each region. \n\nWe are able to see precious information about the density of each type of business within the areas. It can be a preliminary analysis, saying that if there is no existence of certain types of business, it is more likely to tell that there is no demand of that particular service. On the other hand, it is also the new opportunity of the enterprise to enter the market. Please noted that this analysis is using only venues, without other socioeconomic/demographic information.\n",

The Foursquare API will also used for getting venues information of each neighborhood.\n\nThe machine learning algorihm that might be presented is K-means clustering. It will be grouping the similar neighborhood together and some visualization will be provided as well. ",
